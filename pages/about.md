# About

Ali Hassan is determined and committed to achieve his goal while enjoying the process of leaning. He chose Bioinformatics as his interdisciplinary study field which as daunting decision. However, he had to be good at Mathematics, Biology, Computer Science, and Statistics all at the same time. Nonetheless, inspire of the sheer commitment that was required by this degree wo started his Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at [Forman Christian College](https://www.fccollege.edu.pk/) in Pakistan. Soon he quickly realized that he program was not as established as other majors, because bioinformatics still required optimal attention. However, one thing that fascinated that he had to struggle to learn the material, but he discovered a fascinating fact; all the information about living beings is contained in their DNA, and with the right skills, he could decode this information to make predictions about organism.

This realization had a huge impact on Ali Hassan and there forth paved his into completing the degree with further commitment and interest. He knew that to make difference and to learn more from this degree he had to comminute his education that took to pursuing a Master's degree in [Masters in Bioinformatics at Universität des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/study/programmes/master/bioinformatics.html) in Germany, and furthermore he is to continue on to a Ph.D.
