hi everyone guys
bioinformatics guy here with another
video of the series python for
bioinformatics
in this video we will be talking about
collections python has different
items that group together different
items if these items can contain
unlimited numbers of different things it
could be integer strings and it could be
anything
in python the good thing is that even
these collections can also contain
different collections so you can make a
mixture of things as per your
requirements so in python no strings are
arrived there are no limitations and you
can do anything you want to do
so let's get started so in this video we
will touch upon three basic types of
python collections
and later on we will deeply discuss
those collections in detail so the first
thing that we are going to
discuss is sets sets do not allow
duplicate items and they also don't
allow individual access to the elements
of the cell then we have the sequences
in sequences we have numerical indexing
like 0 1 2 3 you can access any of the
element by giving the index then we have
mappings mappings is a very special kind
of thing and it's also very useful so
in mapping what we have is we have a key
a name
and then we have its value so the
difference between these different types
of collections
is based on how we can access individual
elements in those collections
so let's talk about sets a set is an
unordered collection of elements with no
duplicates in python you can make a new
set very easily what you have to do is
you have to use the set function
and then in these round brackets you
have to give
a string or anything which is iteratable
so
you can give it a t g c t
a g c t a g c a sequence and when you
will run this
you will get a set with all the
individual unique values in this string
and these this string will be splitted
up by each character
so you got a c gt now
this way you can simply check that all
of the characters
are either a t g and c's since there is
no indexing elements of the sets can
appear in any order
let's see a few more examples of sets
and we can make
dna bases is equal to t comma
a comma g comma c
and if we print this we got this
similarly by the same token we can make
rna bases
and instead of t we will put u over here
so we got
rna bases as well as the dna bases so
when a string is inside these curly
braces
and we run this code we see that a set
is created but the string is not
splitted up into individual characters
and the same thing goes with when you
have
multiple sets of strings like let's say
you have these two strings then you will
see that now
this set contains two unique elements
with the help of sets we can write
validate base sequence
very easily so we will define
validate base sequence and then we will
give it
a base sequence let's create rna flag as
well
and initially we will keep it false now
let's add a dog string as well because
it is really good practice to add doc
strings
we will say that return true
if the string base
sequence contains only upper
or lower case t
or u in case of
rna flag a
g and c characters otherwise
let's close this stock string and oh we
were not supposed to run this
um let's complete this function first so
now what we can return we can return in
just like one line
we will return you know we created these
rna bases and dna bases so let's put
them in the function
we had a string and then we used this
set function and it returned the unique
values
now we can do the same thing over here
we will say
set and then we will take it
or we will keep base sequence over here
then we will check if set is less than
or equal to rna basis if
rna flag else dna bases let's define
this first
it's again giving us an error
oh the spellings are not correct now
this function is defined and let's try
running this
print validate base sequence over here
we can give it
a t g c t h g we see that we see that
this c
and c is small so it's always a good
idea to see
if our dna based sequence or rna based
sequence is in capital letters or small
letters
you can use dot upper to modify this
let's keep it this way
and we have to rerun this and redefine
the function
now it is supposed to give us true if we
will add some
random character like y and it is
supposed to give us
false and if we change it to u
and also give it another argument
then which is true then it also supposed
to give us
true and because it's an rna sequence
and if we make it a dna sequence
and or keep the rna flag true it is
supposed to give us
false okay so let's talk about sequences
sequences are
ordered pair in which there can be
duplicates
and we can access individual elements of
the sequence unfortunately in python
we have sequences as well as in
bioinformatics we have dna
rna sequences so whenever i'm talking
about a python sequence i will
explicitly say
python sequence otherwise i will say the
sequence as i already told you that
these are ordered and we can access them
with the help of proper indexing
now there are six types of python
sequences string
bytes byte arrays range tuples
and list very important one less we have
already talked a little bit about
strings in the previous videos we will
also talk about them
in detail in the future and buys and
buys arrays are not important
so in this video we will briefly discuss
range tuple and list so let's start with
range we add another heading
range so a range represents a series of
integers
it might not look very useful at the
moment but in python it has a very
fundamental role
so with one argument range and then we
add a stopping point but
one thing it will not include the stop
integer when you will run
range 4 it will give you a range object
you can also check its
type by you using the function
its type is range what we have to do is
we have to convert it into set
in order to get the unique values or we
can also change it to
list and it will give you a list right
so let's talk about set screens we
already know what sets are
so we will change this to set now you
can see that we got
0 1 2 and 3 but we haven't got
four we got four characters but we
haven't got the fourth
four integer you can also call range
range with
two arguments in which we have a
starting point as well as an ending
point let's
say if we want to start from true and
end at 4
then it will give us only 2 and 3
because 4 is not included
now there is a interesting question what
will happen
if the starting point is greater than
the ending point
like this if it is 6 over here and 4
at the end what will happen you can find
this out on your own and
comment down below and let me know there
is a third argument as well
and that is when you need a step so if
we want to go from one to ten
and skip every second element we will
write the step as two
so now you see that we got one then two
is kept then we got three then
four is kept and we got 5 and if we
change it to
2 then we would be able to get all the
even numbers up and down
so i have already showed you a few
examples but let's discuss
about some examples when the step isn't
negative
when the step is in negative it will go
back
it will go in the reverse order and then
our starting and ending points are also
supposed to be according to the negative
steps
right now we see that 2 is not included
the ending point is always not included
but the starting 10 is included
we can see that if we want to start from
0 and go up till -25
with step of 5 with step of 5
then we can see that we got this
negative table
from starting from minus 20 up going up
till
uh zero so that's all about
range is let's talk about tuples let me
make it a heading
so tuple is an immutable sequence that
can contain
any type of element so in order to
create a tuple we use round brackets
and we can put strings over here so this
is a tuple
and we can also create one element tuple
just like that we can also create an
empty tuple
this is an empty tuple let me zoom in a
little bit have you noticed that i have
made a
small mistake over here you can see that
if we
we have atcg and this is in the bracket
if we have only one element and we put
it
in the round braces we see that we got
this string
it is not a tuple you can even check
its type and you will see that it's not
a stop you know you it is a string
in order to make a tuple with one
element you will have to add a comma
after the first element so that in that
way it will know that this is going to
be a tuple now it's a tuple so just like
the sets
if we put a string in round brackets we
will get
individual elements as double so we got
this atg
ac now this is the tuple as we were
previously discussing the range we can
also make tuples
from a range from 5 to 10. so we got
another tuple
so tuples are not that much used in
python so let's move to
less and i'm telling you lists are very
important
in python so list is a mutable sequence
of any kind of element lists
are highly flexible that's why they are
widely applicable
type of the container one way of
thinking about lists is that lists are
mu tabletop
in tuples we we saw that we cannot make
any changes to the tuples but unless we
can make any kind of changes we can add
the elements we can delete the elements
we can
change the elements we can do anything
we want to do and that is the same
reason why tuples are not most commonly
used
because they are not mutable and we
usually need to update the list
and change and do things like that and
we are not allowed to do that with the
tuples
so tuppers have very specific kind of
use when you know that you are going to
create a sequence
and you don't need to change anything
you don't need to add anything you are
supposed to use it just the way it is
so syntax of list is very easy you will
use scare brackets
and then you can add elements you can
add
integers then you can put on a string
over here
then you can add a float over here and
every element is supposed to be
separated by commas you can also
add another list in in this let's run
this and you got a list
in which we have different elements an
integer a string
a float and another list which contains
two elements a string
uh two integers let's create two lists
list one and let's add a few elements
one two and three let's create another
list
list two and let's add some other
elements
four five that's all
and now we can add two list very simply
so print
list one plus
list two so we got one two three four
five
and if we will print list one again
we will see that the list one has not
changed now if we want to change or
mutate the list one
what we have to you do is we have to use
this
extend function list one
dot extend and then we can extend it by
with the uh by list2 so
now if we will run printless one
list one will be updated
see we got one two three four five but
since we haven't performed
any function on list two if we will
print list
two uh then we will see that list2
is not modified it's just the way it was
so let's talk about the last and very
important thing
mappings so there is only one kind of
mapping in python and that is this
dictionary this physical dictionary and
python's dictionary are
very similar in this dictionary we we
know that we have this word mexican
and then there will be a definition of
mexican and in python we also have a
word or a key and then we have a value
of that key
so one important thing about dictionary
is that these are
unordered and they are mutable
you can make changes in the dictionaries
apart from that we can access
individual elements of dictionaries by
using the specific value of a specific
key so
let's create a very simple dictionary as
we know that there are four bases a t
g and c and then we know that they
represent adenine gone in thymine and
cytosine
we can create a dictionary for that and
to create a dictionary we will be using
curly braces
and our keys are supposed to be in the
strings because these are the names
so our first key could be at a
and its value is going to be followed up
by
this colon so
we have a d e n i n e adenine
then we have the g for
g g u a and i n e gone in
then we have c for
cytosine
then we have t
for thymine t ts by mini
now we have created a dictionary in
which we have we have four
keys a g c and t and their values are is
is value is adenine
g's value is gone in c value cytosine
and t's value is thymine so
that's all that i want to talk about
dictionaries in this videos because
in the next video we will talk about the
dictionary in great detail so
that's all for today and if you have any
questions comments or concerns about
this video you can put them in the
comments down below i will happy to help
you
out apart from that if you want to see

is a facebook group
you will find the link in the
description down below
and if you want to know what i do other

vlogging channel
so that's all for today thank you very
much for watching and i will see you
