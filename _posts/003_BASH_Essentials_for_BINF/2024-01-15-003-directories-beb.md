Think of the file system as your computer's organizer. It manages files (holds information) and directories (folders that hold files or more folders).

Let's start exploring your computer using the command line.


## Check Your Computer Name

Type `whoami` and press enter. Your computer's name should appear. Here's how it works:
- The shell looks for a program called whoami.
- It runs the program.
- The program's output (your computer name) is displayed.
- A new prompt appears, indicating readiness for more commands.

For example: 

~~~ {.bash}
$:whoami
~~~
~~~ {.output}
ali 
~~~

## Print Working Directory

To find out where we are, use the `pwd` command, which stands for **print working directory**. The current working directory is our default location for running commands, unless we specify otherwise.


~~~ {.bash}
$:pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/Users/ali
~~~

Welcome to your **home directory**! To understand the concept, let's explore the overall organization of the file system, using our scientist Nelle's computer as an example. Later, you'll learn commands to navigate your own filesystem, structured similarly but not precisely identical.

| The home directory path varies across operating systems. On a Mac, it might resemble `/Users/username`, while on Windows, it could be more like `/c/Users/username`. In our examples, we default to Mac output.


## Listing stuff in the current directory

To explore the contents of our filesystem from the command line, we use the `ls` command, short for "listing." This command prints the names of files and directories in the current directory, arranging them alphabetically into neat columns.

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
$:ls
1by2.cif	Desktop		Library		Pipfile
2ja4.cif	Documents	Movies		Public
Applications	Downloads	Music		mambaforge
Calibre Library	Google Drive	Pictures	micromamba
~~~

Enhance your file insights by employing **flags** or **arguments**. Let's delve into `ls -t` and `ls -tlh`. The -t flag organizes items based on their last edit time. Combining flags allows us to perform multiple actions simultaneously, such as sorting by time (-t), displaying all details (-l), and presenting file sizes in a human-readable format (-h).


~~~ {.bash}
ls -l
~~~
~~~ {.output}
total 480

## Change Directory
Apart from inspecting files within directories, we have the capability to shift our current location to another directory, thereby moving away from our home directory. The command used for this operation is cd. To execute the cd command, an argument specifying the directory name is required.

To access the recently downloaded and saved directory named "DataForUnixCourse," a sequence of two commands can be employed to navigate into it.


~~~ {.bash}
$ cd Desktop
$ cd tutorieal_folder
$ cd beb_data
~~~

~~~ {.bash}
ali@host beb_data % 
$ 
~~~

These commands transitioned us from our home directory to the Desktop and then into the `tutorieal_folder` directory.
However, as the cd command doesn't produce any output, our prompt remains empty or displays `$`. To determine our current 
location, we can utilize the informative `pwd` command.

~~~ {.bash}
$ pwd
~~~

~~~ {.output}
/Desktop/tutorieal_folder/beb_data
~~~

And now we can type `ls` to see the contents

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls
~~~

~~~ {.output}
SRR534005_01_R1.fastq           SRR534005_03_R2.fastq                   
SRR534005_01_R2.fastq           chicken.fastq

SRR534005_02_R2.fastq           copy-chicken_01_R2.fastq

copy-chicken_02_R2.fastq        lengths.txt      
copy-chicken_03_R1.fastq        sorted_lengths.tx
copy-chicken_03_R2.fastq        yeast_01_R1.fastq
human_01_R1.fastq               yeast_01_R2.fastq
human_02_R1.fastq               yeast_02_R1.fastq

## Relative Paths vs. Absolute Paths
The computer's directories form a hierarchy, and you can specify them using either a relative path or an absolute path. 
A relative path is based on your current directory, while an absolute path is not influenced by the current directory.

Upon executing the recent `pwd`command, the output displayed something akin to the following:

~~~ {.output}
/Users/ali/Desktop/tutorieal_folder/beb_data
~~~

This is the full path to the beb_data directory on Ali's computer. 

At the pinnacle of the hierarchy is a directory denoted as `/`, commonly known as the root directory. 
Ali's home directory is precisely located at the full path `/Users/ali`. 
Within the home directory, the Desktop serves as a subdirectory, and our project folder is nested within the Desktop.

Directory navigation can be accomplished using either full or relative paths.

## Relative Path Examples 

`.` The single period means **this directory**. This is a relative path to use when you want to copy files from somewhere else to your current directory

`..` The double period means **one directory up in the hierarchy**. This is useful when you want to move up one directory by typing `cd ..`. You can use this in a combination, for example: `cd ../..` will go up two directories or `cd ../Pictures/` will move up to the Desktop and then into Pictures. 


## Examples of Relative Paths

- `.`: The single period signifies the current directory. 
It is a relative path useful for copying files from elsewhere to your current directory.

- `..`: The double period denotes moving one directory up in the hierarchy. 
This is beneficial when you wish to ascend one directory level using the `cd ..` command. 

It can be used in combinations such as `cd ../..` to go up two directories or `cd ../Pictures/` 
to ascend to the Desktop and then navigate into the Pictures directory.



## Home Shortcuts

Navigating to the home directory can be done by typing the full path `/Users/username`, but this involves a considerable amount of typing. 
An alternative is to use the `~` symbol, which can replace `/c/Users/username` in full path descriptions. 
However, for Unix users who find even the `~` too cumbersome, simply using the `cd` command followed by the return or 
enter key accomplishes the same, swiftly taking you back to the home directory. 
Therefore, any of these three commands will reliably guide you home, regardless of your current location in the file system:


~~~ {.bash}
$ cd /c/Users/username
$ cd ~
$ cd
~~~


## Three "navigating the file system" challenges

**1. In two steps, navigate to your "Downloads" directory then to your "Pictures" Directory**

**2. Navigate to your "data" directory. Next navigate to your "Desktop" using relative commands.**

**3. What command will get you from anywhere in your file system to your home directory with the fewest key strokes?**


## Here is a summary of some of the commands we just practiced.

## Tab Completion Shortcut
We've recently covered some shorthand notations that help us save time when typing. Another highly useful shortcut is known as tab completion. 
When entering a directory or file name, simply type the first few characters and then press the `tab` button. Your computer will automatically append the subsequent unique characters.
